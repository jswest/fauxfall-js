# Fauxfall
## This is the beginning of something wonderful.

### What is it?
Fauxfall is an attempt to recreate and expand upon the New York _Times_ piece, "[Snow Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek)" using an _Atlantic_ article and associated rich media. It is proof-of-concept, not a finished product, but, still, it should have an expansive feature set—ideally above and beyond what "Snow Fall" showed was possible.

### Just what are these features?
Well, here's a sampling of what we're thinking:
- Highlights and Annotations _a la_ Rap Genius
- Embedded HTML5 video and audio
- A UX that seamlessly supports learning more in the form of _Wikipedia_-esque "notecards" of further information
- Slideshows
- Quasi-infinite scroll
- Parallaxed/cutout background images

### How is it?
JavaScript through and through. Node.js on the back and Backbone.js on the front. CSS3 transitions and transforms, so modern browsers only—not even graceful degradation for IE <= 8. So there. Also, it runs on p 5000.

### Who is it?
Fauxfall is the brainchild of @jswest and Karim, who doesn't, I don't think have a Github, with ample support from @gabeisman. @jswest and @gabeisman will be coding the crap out of it.
