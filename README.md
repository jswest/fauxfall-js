# Fauxfall
## This is the beginning of something wonderful.

# What is it?
Fauxfall is an attempt to recreate and expand upon the New York _Times_ piece, "[Snow Fall](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek)" using an _Atlatnic_ article and associated rich media. It is proof-of-concept, not a finished product, but, still, it should have an expansive feature setâ€”ideally above and beyond what "Snow Fall" showed was possible.
